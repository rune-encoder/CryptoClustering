# CryptoClustering

## Description

This project is about clustering cryptocurrencies based on their price changes over different timeframes like 24 hours, 7 days, 30 days, and more. We used two main tools: K-means clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA).  

First, we scaled the data, then applied K-means to group the cryptocurrencies, and finally used PCA to simplify the data and cluster them again. Hopefulling, helping us find patterns in how these prices move together over time.
